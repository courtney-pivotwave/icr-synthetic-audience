Respond in this exact JSON structure — nothing else:

{
  "whats_landing": [
    "Keep [specific element] — [one sentence on why it works, citing persona evidence]"
  ],
  "whats_falling_flat": [
    "Fix [specific element] — [one sentence on why it fails, citing persona evidence]"
  ],
  "rewrite_brief": [
    {
      "priority": 1,
      "instruction": "A single directive sentence: what to cut, rewrite, add, or sharpen — specific enough to act on without further clarification",
      "example": "Optional: a concrete one-sentence rewrite demonstrating the change. Only include if the rewrite makes the instruction meaningfully clearer."
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- whats_landing: 2-3 items. Only include elements with genuine signal — things that actually moved scores or prevented objections. Phrase as "Keep [X]" so the writer knows what not to touch.
- whats_falling_flat: 2-3 items. Be specific about what's not working and why. Phrase as "Fix [X]" so the writer has a clear target.
- rewrite_brief: Exactly 3 items, ranked by impact. Each instruction must be specific enough that a copywriter can execute it today without asking a follow-up question. No vague directives like "be more specific" — tell them what to be specific about.
- example field: Only add this when a rewrite example genuinely clarifies the instruction. Skip it when the instruction is already clear on its own.
- Do not hedge. Do not say "consider" or "might." Give directives.`,
